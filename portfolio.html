            As the branding and product designer, I created a brand guide
            including a logo, colour palette, and typography. I also Designed a
            web landing page to highlight marketing materials and subscriptions
            features. Finally, I delivered high fidelity prototypes for the
            language learning platform’s mobile and web apps.

          <p>
            While completing my Digital Experience Internship at Nova Scotia
            Power, I contributed towards an upcoming web update project. This
            included creating web mockups to improve the mobile experience and a
            menu overhaul to address navigation challenges. In addition to the
            update project, I also completed routine web updates and the
            creation of new pages.

            I acted as a web designer and developer for westridge properties,
            creating a website using Figma, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Filezilla,
            and Hostinger. In addition to web design and development, I created
            branding materials including a logo and typography. While working
            for Westridge, I also set up internal storage procedures for easy
            access to company materials and documentation.

          <p>
            Fresh For All is a prototype I created as part of a research project
            during my Master of Digital Innovation. The research project was
            exploring how people with mild cognitive impairment, including early
            stage dementia can benefit from assistive technology. This project
            culminated in a proposed prototype for Fresh For All, an assistive
            cooking application designed to help people with cognitive
            impairment cook independently and safely. Accessible design is
            something I am very passionate about and this project was a great
            opportunity to explore how accessible technology can help people of
            different abilities.

            PlentiFull is a portfolio practicum created for my Bachelor of

            market research, brand design, product design, and business strategy
            to create a new venture concept. These prototypes show the layout
            for a delivery service providing sustainable refills of household
            goods and cosmetic products.
